  abstract = {Neuropsychological assessment aids in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by objectively establishing cognitive impairment from standardized tests. We present new criteria for diagnosis that use weighted combined scores from multiple tests. Our method employs two multivariate analyses: principal components analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis. PCA (N = 216 participants) created more interpretable cognitive dimensions by resolving 49 test measures in our neuropsychological battery to 13 component scores for each participant. The component scores were used to build discriminant functions that classified each participant as either an early-stage AD (N = 55) or normal elderly (N = 78). Our discriminant function performed with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (nearly all >90%) in the development, a cross-validation, and a new-subjects validation. When contrasted to two different traditional empirical methods for diagnosis (using cutscores and defining AD as falling below 5% on two or more test domains), our results suggested that the multivariate method was superior in classification (approximately 20% more accurate).},

  abstract = {The neuropsychological battery from the National Alzheimer's Disease Coordinating Center is designed to provide a sensitive assessment of mild cognitive disorders for multicenter investigations. Comprising 8 common neuropsychological tests (12 measures), the battery assesses cognitive domains affected early in the course of Alzheimer disease. We examined the factor structure of the battery across levels of cognition [normal, mild cognitive impairment, dementia] based on Clinical Dementia Rating scores to determine cognitive domains tapped by the battery. Using data pooled from 29 Alzheimer's Disease Centers funded by National Institute on Aging, exploratory factor analysis was used to derive a general model using half of the sample; 4 factors representing memory, attention, executive function, and language were identified. Confirmatory factor analysis was used on the second half of the sample to evaluate invariance between groups and within groups over 1 year. Factorial invariance testing included systematic addition of constraints and comparisons of nested models. The general confirmatory factor analysis model had a good fit. As constraints were added, model fit deteriorated slightly. Comparisons within groups showed stability over 1 year. In a range of cognition from normal to dementia, factor structures and factor loadings will vary little. Further work is needed to determine whether domains become more or less distinct in severely cognitively compromised individuals.},
